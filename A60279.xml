            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

               <hi>THE following Treatise was the real Result of my Soul, and my sincere Thoughts digested into Method; I chose the way of Dialogue, as being the most pleasing to the Reader, for men should entic'd to their Duty by all lawful means: I have Publish'd it on no other score but hoping it may do some

               <p>WELL met my dear <hi>Philotheus:</hi> It is al<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>most an Age since last I saw you, and now you're so strangely alter'd, that at first, I scarcely knew you: What's the occasion of this change? where's all that Gayety and Mirth which us'd to dwell upon your pleasant Brow? Where's the alluring Mein? The taking Smiles? Where the Fine Dress? And all the other Winning Arts with which you gain'd the Ladies good esteem? Sure some strange misfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tune has befallen you, which has occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sion'd this unexpected metamorphosis.</p>
            </sp>
            <sp>
               <speaker>Philotheus.</speaker>
               <p>No <hi>Philocosme,</hi> The best, the greatest, chiefest Happiness, Heaven can bestow, or man enjoy, is the reason of what you call a metamorphosis.</p>

               <speaker>Philocos.</speaker>
               <p>And is it thus you thank kind Heaven for the Blessing; For shame, cast off those melancholly looks, assume your wonted Jollity, and let us to the Tavern, and there over a chearful Bottle give the Gods thanks for their Favours.</p>

               <speaker>Philothe.</speaker>
               <p>Softly <hi>Philocosme,</hi> and I'le shew you, how much you are mistaken in both points; for neither am I melancholly, nor is a Tavern, and a Bottle fit returns to Heaven for his mercies: What, because I am not mad, must I therefore be melan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cholly? Will you allow no <hi>medium?</hi> Be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cause my Dress is not true Beaux, my Gate affected, my Talk and Laughter loud, and extravagant, must I therefore be melancholly? You're very Hetrodox in your Opinion, for it is the Sober, Vertu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Man, who is the truly chearful, and merry man, his happiness is real, his Joys are perfect, whilst the Airy, Lewd, De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauchee (whom the World calls the man of Wit, and Pleasures) who knows how to use the Blessings of this Life, wilfully stu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dies how to make himself uncapable of re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lishing any Happiness. He makes that
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:35083:5"/> very punishment which the Hollanders in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict on Criminals, and is call'd the Dutch Beverage, his chief delight, thÃ´ cropsick next morning he curses the last night's de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bauch, damns the Company who Revel'd with him, and for a day or two con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>demns himself to Penitential Small-Beer. And is this the way to live happily? I would sooner be damn'd to linger out my wretched life, chain'd to an Oar on board a Spanish Galley.</p>

               <p>And yet <hi>Philotheus,</hi> this was the very life you led for some years, nay you were one of the Topping Extrava<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gants, and strove with eagerness to Out<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>do your lazy Comrades. You were the Chiefest Champion for it, curs'd all Mo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rals, and the Plodding Fools who taught them first, call'd all a Trick, a meer De<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sign of old, envious Dotards, who being by Age and Impotence depriv'd of the possibility of enjoyment, would needs impose those merciless Curbs on the High<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mettled Youth.</p>

They enjoy a happy and a silent peace within their quiet brests, verifying that of the Prophet: <hi>Her ways are ways of pleasantness; and her paths are peace.</hi> No rude, and loud all arms of a clamorous and troublesome Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>science disturb their rest, or rack their Souls. In the morning they rise with a sedate and quiet mind, their bodies and their Souls keeping a blest Harmony, are both alike in Heavenly temper. The Sober man is free from sad Reflections, how he spent the Yesterday; nor is he troubled tacitely to question himself: Have I any Quarrel on my hands? Did I fall, out with any one last night?

Such a man<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner of life Un-mans men, Debases those of the highest Quality, to the meanest and vilest Abjects. A Heathen could say <hi>Nobilitas sola est atque unica Virtus.</hi> And shall a Christian, who has the hopes and prospect of a Heaven hereafter, added as a Reward for his living well, shall he be out-strip'd by a Heathen, in the Race of Vertue? I believe, my Friend, you durst (were your Country, King, or Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berties at Stake) rush boldly midst the Thundring War, Fight Valiantly under
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:35083:7"/> your Prince's Banner for the preservation of those Dear Pledges, and by your Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring, shun the hated name of Coward; Why will you then prove less Valiant un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>der a more Glorious Banner?

               <p>All Innocent Freedoms are lawful, but I fear by your mentioning a Venial Sin, you mean Fornication, if so avoid it as you would the Plague, or any worse Disease; there's Deadly Poyson in't. You must not be almost, but altogether a Christian: Men may sooth themselves with Fancies, but sure no Sin without sincere Repentance, will be pardon'd, and I do not know any one Crime against which God's Vengeance is more, and fre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quenter Denounced than this: The Scrip<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tures
<pb n="10" facs="tcp:35083:9"/> are full of Woes against the Adul<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>terers and Whoremongers; and foreseeing that this Sin would be the Chiefest Allure<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment with which the Devil can tempt man, has taken all necessary care to fore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>warn and arm us against it: <hi>The Whore<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mongers and Adulterers God will judge,</hi> and again, <hi>They shall not enter into the Kingdom of Heaven:</hi> No Unclean thing shall get admittance into the Coelestial Habitations, and can any thing be more filthy, or un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clean than a Whoremonger? And besides the Terrible Judgements denounc'd in the Scriptures against those who commit the Sin of Uncleaness, it has seem'd good to the Divine Wisdom and Justice to in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flict a very Severe and Dreadful Punish<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment even in this Life, which tho' it do's not always light upon the Guilty break<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>er of the Seventh Command, yet it com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>monly overtakes the Hardned Sinner. How many Wretched Examples have we seen of miserable people who infected with the Veneral Plague, have lingred out a miserable Life here in Dismal Agonies, and Fearful Torments, and without the
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:35083:9"/> particular mercy of an Indulgent Creator, and the Earnest mediation of a Powerful Advocate, must also Howl Eternally in another World for the Satisfaction of Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>stice and Expiation of the Sin. What Mischiefs has Lust been the Author and Contriver of? How many Murthers have been committed on this score? How ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ny States and Kingdoms entirely Ruin'd by nothing but Unbridled Lust? From hence has sprung Incests, Parracide and a Train of Woes, which are the constant Attenders of that Sin. The Silly <hi>Indians</hi> who Barter Gold and Jewels for Glass and Beads, make much a better Bargain, than he who forfeits Eternity for a Moment's Pleasure. Sure nothing but the greatest Stupidity imaginable could be guilty of so gross a Folly? <hi>What shall a man profit, if he gain the whole world, and lose his own soul?</hi> It is strange, that men that are so wise and crafty in their dealings here, so Politick in the Trifling things of this Transitory World, should be such Fools in the great Business of their Souls.

<pb n="23" facs="tcp:35083:15"/> to the Truly Penitent: Read the Scriptures carefully, where you will find all the Comfort you can hope for. No Father e're us'd his First-born with more Tenderness, than Heaven does the return<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing Sinner. Christ invites him to come unto him, with all the Endearing Expres<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>sions a Heavenly Love can use: Nay, tells you, that all the Heavenly Choire rejoice at a Sinner's Conversion; and the Holy Angels are Interess'd in your Happy Change. And as Despair is the most ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cursed state which any Miserable Wretch can fall into, so the Sacred Writ has ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken a peculiar tender care, that man should avoid that dismal condition: And has not only by Exhortations invited the Sin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ner to Repent, that he may be Forgiven, but has also given us several Instances of Notorious Sinners who have by their Repentance become very Dear to God.
